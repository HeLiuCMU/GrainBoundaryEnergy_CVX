# iterate300/:
  contain the output from Amdam's Code, iteration = 300
# Yufeng.ipynb:
  loading data to matrix A and initialize X, Yufeng Shen
# Huber_AccProjGD.ipynb
  accelerated projected gradient descent with Huber cost function, He Liu
# readtmx.py:
  read fortran output, Yufeng Shen
# huber_accGD_outputs:
  outputs from Huber_AccProjGD.ipynb
  cap_vec and energy from different iterations from different method, for futher comaparison
# cap_vec_iteration0.res:
  zeroth output from Adam's code
  or just norm vector n
  used for calculate energy from cap_vec, e = cap_vec*n
